# Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio

[Deployed Site](https://peaceful-tundra-86754.herokuapp.com)

For the latest version of my portfolio I used a react and materialize to create a mobile-first application to display my completed projects and links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and my resume. 

Current issues are that upon deployement two of the project images do not display. Additionally, I wanted to set the data for the projects page up in a mongoose database and was unable to get the api calls working before the required submission date. 

For future development I would like to get the database working, as well as add animation to the elements on the pages.

## Updates

4/6/2020 Missing images finally pushed to heroku and displaying correctly
5/2/2020 Updated so that projects pull from database rather than an array
